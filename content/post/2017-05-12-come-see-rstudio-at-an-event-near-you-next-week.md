We love to engage with R and RStudio users online in webinars and communities because it is so efficient for everyone. But sometimes it's great to meet in person, too!

Next week RStudio will be in Miami, Baltimore and Chicago. We wanted to let you know in case you'll be there at the same time and want to "Connect" (yes, we said it :)) with us.

At each of these events we'll have the latest books signed by RStudio authors, t-shirts to win, demonstrations of RStudio Connect and RStudio Server Pro and, of course, stickers and cheatsheets. Share with us what you're doing with RStudio and get your product and company questions answered!

**Apache Big Data - Miami**

If big data is your thing, you use R, and you're headed to [Apache Big Data](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apache-big-data-north-america) in Miami May 15th through the 18th, you can find out in person how easy and practical it is to analyze big data with R and Spark.

While you're at the conference be sure to look us up at booth number 104 during the Expo Hall hours.

**PharmaSUG - Baltimore**

If you're in the Pharma industry, you use R, and you're headed to [PharmaSUG](https://pharmasug.org/us/index.html) in Baltimore May 14th through the 17th, we hope you'll look us up. PharmaSUG is a not-to-be-missed event for programmers, statisticians, data managers, and others in the pharmaceutical, healthcare, and related industries.

Phil Bowsher from RStudio will be presenting _An Introduction to Shiny, R Markdown, and HTML Widgets for R with Applications in Drug Development_ at 8am on Sunday, May 14th.

We will be in booth number 204 during the Expo Hall hours.

**R/Finance - Chicago**

Every year, new and interesting ways R is used in the financial industry surface at [R/Finance](http://www.rinfinance.com/). If you're going to Chicago May 19th and the 20th, we hope you'll come talk to us. You can't miss us at R/Finance!

Jonathan Regenstein from RStudio will be presenting _Reproducible Finance: A Global ETF Map and Shiny App_ at 2pm on Saturday, May 20th.

Otherwise, if those aren't places you'll be next week, look for us in London, San Francisco, Brussels, or one of the many other [events coming soon](https://www.rstudio.com/about/news-events/)!
