[**RStudio Server Pro AWS** ](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B06W2G9PRY/?ref=_ptnr_devblg_)is identical to [RStudio Server Pro](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio-server-pro/), but with turnkey convenience. It comes pre-configured with multiple versions of R, common systems libraries, and the most popular R packages.

RStudio Server Pro AWS helps you adapt to your unique circumstances. It allows you to choose different AWS computing instances no matter how large, whenever a project requires it (flat hourly pricing). Or you can set up a persistent instance of RStudio Server Pro ready to be used anytime you need it (annual pricing), avoiding the sometimes complicated processes for procuring on-premises software.

If the enhanced security, elegant support for multiple R versions and multiple sessions, and commercially licensed and supported features of RStudio Server Pro appeal to you and your enterprise, consider RStudio Server Pro for AWS. It's ready to go!
