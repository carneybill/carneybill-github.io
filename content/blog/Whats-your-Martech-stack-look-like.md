### The Standardized Martech Stack
What's your standardized Martech stack? Do you know what's running? Do you know the overlaps and are you willing to accept them?

The purpose of documenting the stack is to consolidate for continuity and control. Some of the vendors you work with may collect PII (Personal Identifiable Information) on your behalf or may not integrate into our databases of record for subscription management. All Marketing technology used must include links to privacy policies to understand what they do – you should not standardize on software that does not automatically integrate or is not GDPR compliant.  I’ve tried to keep the tech stack to 4 journey categories:

- **Attraction** – Unknown, Dark, Net New
- **Engagement** – Customers & prospects, Community, Education
- **Conversion** – Right time targeting, Free trial & evaluations
- **Optimization** – Data driven decision making, Standardized reporting

## Standardized Rules:
- **Integration** – our tools must work well together and integrate with existing technology. 
- **Centralized data** – tools cannot duplicate data or use different data sources for their operations. 
- **Multi-channel** – We have a requirement to engage with prospects across multiple platforms with a series of interactions that are fully integrated together.
- **Insight** – Data-driven insights though data analytics provided from our Martech stack is a requirement. Additionally, we need agreement on what KPIs to measure – see centralized data.
- **Flexible** – Todays marketing strategy might be different in a couple of years. We’ll need to bear in mind the future in mind and consider how we can adapt and scale quickly.
- **Real-time** – Optimal if we can count on real-time data updates.
