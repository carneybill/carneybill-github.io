![Tachyons Logo Script](/blog/assets/tachyons-logo-script-feature.png)

## [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io) is a design system that allows you to design gorgeous interfaces in the browser with little effort.

### Because Speed

Building this static site generator theme was the first time I used an Atomic
(or Functional) CSS system like Tachyons. It's a design system that provides
very small (which means fast) CSS modules that you can use in your HTML. So,
rather than writing every line of CSS, you apply the style you need as you write
your HTML with easy to understand shorthand class names. This makes for a very
powerful way to style, in the browser, or while building a static site like this
one â€“ since you can see every change with every save. **It's a joy to use.**

In using this theme for your next static website project, you won't need to know
anything about Tachyons ... so, don't freak out. Even though I used it to style
the theme, you won't need to change a thing. BUT, if you do want to play around
with it, you can make massive changes very easily. Just familiarize yourself
with the [clear documentation on the design system](http://tachyons.io/docs/).
Once you dive in, you'll recognize all the classes I'm using in the markup.
