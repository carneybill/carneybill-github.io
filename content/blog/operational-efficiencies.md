2021 must be focused on minimizing unnecessary and unproductive expenses and delivering sales qualified leads that convert to opportunities - it’s really that simple. The marketing pendulum must dramatically shift towards an Agile but deliberate approach (scrappy) focused on Net New and away from branding exercises and vanity metrics. This is supported by the fact that we truly don’t have a branding budget, nor should we be allowed one until we have our Software AG umbrella story completed and vetted with a mapped execution strategy.

If we are to hit our targets, we must move marketing closer to the money focusing on SQLs tightly aligned with sales. We’ve already put in place software that unifies systems and manages daily operations. It’s now necessary to analyze the data we gather to turn it into insight and track the journey (specifically optimizing mid funnel) of a prospect effectively creating programs to convert.

Restructuring roles to qualified people
Process and operational standardization are very important goals particularly when you are operating in constrained times from a budget perspective.  We need to reallocate staff to focus on digital/conversion and place the right people in the right roles.  

People in the Strategic Initiative group must be moved into roles where they are measured on tangible business outcomes. There is no such thing as a global event. There is need for reshaping digital events to time zones and language specifics requirements. Marketing should not be a resting place for people without the relevant experience.  
Our web team needs to be experts in the Adobe Suite. Potentially we could disband and outsource our website to AEM experts that can scale. We need to eliminate “learning on the job” and hire professionals that push us to be better. 
We also need to disband “digital” and separate paid versus organic – allocating the headcounts into specific areas of direct accountability.  Paid would be absorbed into Programs and Organic would be absorbed into the Web team. This will allow complete and accountable focus on improving conversions.
There ought to be a single person in charge of all field marketing.  I personally gravitate towards complete accountability or “One throat to choke”. Global activities ought to dovetail into the regional activity execution and requires tight coordination. This is especially true in a digital world as we do not want to compete with each other in paid media driving prices up. While at the same time ensuring best practices are shared and competition between the regions increases. 
I’ve already started a process with my team of getting sign offs between organizations for 2021 sales plays and campaigns. Operation in a silo is unacceptable from any unit in SoftwareAG. These very focused “tiger teams” need to continue. The marketing, sales, and business units need to consistently be working on the same objectives.
We ought to consider moving the SDR team to be part of the Marketing organization with one global lead for consistency. The tighter SDR executes with marketing alignment the deeper a partnership with sales develops and the better conversions will be.

Branding campaigns are important but not right now
We currently do not have the funding nor resources for global branding campaigns.  There also seems to be confusion in the company as to what our brand is.  The brand is SoftwareAG - period. You need a strong hand to control the message and its representation to the marketplace as indicated by all of the analysts we’ve spoken to.

We can prepare ourselves for branding continuity.  To this end we ought to have what is called a “Headless Website”.  Adobe maintains the content for the site and becomes our pivot point for everything branded – Zero alternative options to all BUs. In this proposed environment the content for the site is accessible via a web-service API, usually in a RESTful manner and in a mashup-friendly format such as JSON. The end-user experience is delivered by a Javascript application rendering the output of this API into HTML. This adds an additional layer of abstraction between end users and the website.

This process sets us free from the conventions and structures of the backend. This means we can address our subscription customer journey issue by allowing our subscription products to look and feel like our website. It also means we can never be locked in by a vendor as we could use the connections to supply branding content to whatever platform we want - TechCommunity, Aris, Trendminer or any new company that may be acquired. We operationalize the hook up and not simply place an “X by SoftwareAG” logo replacement. This was not a consideration when the new site MVP was launched.

Streamline all processes and measure everything
Gartner states that buyer enablement is “the provisioning of information that supports the completion of critical activities necessary to make a purchase.”.  I’d suggest “buyer enablement” is simply removing friction to consume contextually relevant content. Prospects self-educate, and therefore self-qualify. This self-education increases velocity, conversion rates, and average deal sizes. We need to continuously improve our content as well as how easy it gets used on the website and test any hypothesis we may have on an ongoing basis. We currently have an ad hoc approach which needs to evolve into a standardized workflow.

Another benefit to a rigorous approach to marketing measurement is that we can learn to use data as proof of our decisions. We have to question Demand vs. Brand and utilize the priorities you’ve already established.  These tough decisions need to be enforced by budget control. Why would we spend any money at all on A&N? We know the customers and have the tools already to communicate with them on-site, in digital events, user groups, and through emails.

Train everyone to be (capital A) Agile marketers
We need to take a pragmatic problem-solving approach (rather than a “shiny new toy” or “just log a ticket” approach).  I believe the people within the marketing group, with coaching, can move into the modern marketing era. It may sound harsh but people either need to move up or move out. We need everyone to keep focused on finding better solutions that address our key business issues. I’ve setup over 6 weeks of training so far and have opened it up to all of marketing to help them understand coasting along is unacceptable. We need intensity and passion to do the right things for this company. These core concepts help marketing rise to a role of truly driving efficiency, and in turn, revenue.

It’s important, then, for the marketing to build a water-tight process, train the team on the process, and train marketers on how to set things up. Campaigns will be built with specific quantifiable goals in mind at the onset, and then marketers will be trained on how best those goals can be achieved. 

The quick ideas for consideration
Define the overarching brand strategy. Engage the CTO’s office to define and execute on the umbrella story.  The website editorial board must have their active participation and we are approaching them for it we have evangelists and we must start to use them more. 
Establish SAG as a thought leader.  We have been around for 50 years and yet have no presence in the market. At several companies I’ve created the “State of…” annual reports.  They have become so valuable as a thought leadership standard that they actual generate volumes of Net New leads.  SAG should have a “State of Software Connections” annual report.  Where you would write the forward defining for people the directions we take or acquisitions we make.
Open direct customer-acquisition channels. I’ve been part of several organizations that have used a no sales rep approach.  Most end users dread sales engagement and if we can make their experience on our website effective (Adobe Suite) why can’t we route subscriptions appropriately for appropriate products?  This would mean we need to revamp our evaluation process and engagement inside the product.
Evolve the experiences for our customers. In addition to Adobe being under leveraged we have an inconsistent approach to our communities.  The communities we have could be much more powerful if we combined them all together as opposed letting them operate in silos with inconsistent goals. Additionally, we ought to consider in the product marketing for expansion as well as using it to coach and lock in evaluations optimizing for conversion.

5 reasons you want me in the CMO role
Time to Value/Continuity – You need a decision now in this critical year. Already there are discussions happening independent of marketing to create materials that will be wasteful, duplicative, and have no impact. The longer this decision takes and there is no strong hand to say no the more the regions and BU’s will “go rouge” and waste money which we don’t have.
Demand Emphasis on Net New/Renewal – No one in the company is more qualified than I am to focus on this. In the 9 months I’ve been here, with the changes I’ve implemented, I’ve demonstrated that as a fact.
Demonstrated Experience - I’ve led hypergrowth marketing organizations before. Internal promotion sends the right message to the entire organization including a North American focus.
Sales, BU and Marketing alignment – The close collaboration with sales and BUs needs to continue. Being placed in the position will allow directed discussions and accountability to bring the remaining Marketing organization along with driven execution.
Agile Start Up Style Mktg – I believe we need a “Scrappy” “Fact are friendly” approach. A start up mentality is just what Marketing needs with a change to an Agile approach.
