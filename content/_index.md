Marketing should help you create, measure and optimize the journeys of your prospects and customers. Your goal is to deliver specific content that compels them to engage, self-nurture, and move faster through the learning and buying cycle. Every user isn't automatically qualified, you need to discover the right people and earn trust, ultimately building a community of advocates.

The end goal doesn't change, deliver compelling content and create remarkable experiences. Without an overall view and cohesive strategy, any single component failure can destroy all your efforts.

The goal of analytics is to help you determine if your objective has been met - duh. It's a bit more difficult determining program or campaign numbers that you can track to your objectives. Assigning attribution to an interaction has never been more complicated. The sheer number of marketing channels and devices has added levels of complexity. There are plenty of organizations out there that don’t have much of an understanding of their attribution metrics. Lack of understanding does not give you permission to not keep investigating and developing theories.
